/**
 * Retrieves and assembles various properties and entities related to a room based on the provided Home Assistant instance and configuration.
 *
 * This function gathers information such as the room's name, associated entities for icons, the main room entity, problem entities (and whether any problems exist),
 * as well as sensor data including both individual sensors and averaged readings by device class. It also determines if dark mode is enabled in the Home Assistant themes,
 * and calculates whether the room should be considered "active" based on either the main room entity or any light entities.
 *
 * @param hass - The Home Assistant instance containing state and configuration data.
 * @param config - The configuration object specifying area, sensors, and other options for the room.
 * @returns {RoomProperties} An object containing assembled room properties and related entities.
