### Example Bug Report

```yaml
# Home Assistant Version: 2024.1.0
# Card Version: 0.23.0
# Browser: Chrome 120.0
# Issue: Background image not showing

# Configuration:
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: living_room
background:
  image: /local/images/living-room.jpg
  opacity: 30
# Error from browser console:
# Failed to load resource: /local/images/living-room.jpg 404 (Not Found)

# Steps to reproduce:
# 1. Add card to dashboard
# 2. Set background image path
# 3. Image doesn't appear, shows broken icon
```

### Emergency Workarounds

If the card is completely broken:

1. **Remove from dashboard**: Delete card temporarily
2. **Use YAML mode**: Configure manually instead of UI
3. **Revert to previous version**: Downgrade if new version has issues
4. **Use alternative cards**: Button-card or entity cards as temporary replacement
