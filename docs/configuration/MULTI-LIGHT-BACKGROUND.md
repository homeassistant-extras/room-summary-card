# Multi-Light Background Configuration

The multi-light background feature allows the card background to light up when any light entity in the room is on, instead of only when the main room entity is on. This is particularly useful for rooms with multiple lights where you want the background to reflect the actual lighting state of the room.

ðŸ“– **See [Multi-Light Background Example](../advanced/README-EXAMPLES.md#multi-light-background) for configuration details.**

## Basic Setup

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: kitchen
features:
  - multi_light_background
```

## Features

- **Automatic Discovery**: Automatically finds all light entities in the specified area
- **Mixed Entity Support**: Can track any entity type (light, switch, binary_sensor, etc.) that reports on/off state
- **Manual Override**: Specify exactly which entities to track with the `lights` configuration
- **Smart Background**: Shows lit background when ANY tracked light is on (dark mode only)

## Automatic Light Discovery

By default, when `multi_light_background` is enabled, the card automatically finds all entities in the area with the `light.` domain:

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: kitchen
features:
  - multi_light_background
# Automatically tracks: light.kitchen_main, light.kitchen_under_cabinet, etc.
```

## Manual Light Configuration

You can override the automatic discovery by specifying which entities to track:

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: kitchen
features:
  - multi_light_background
lights:
  - light.kitchen_main
  - light.kitchen_under_cabinet
  - switch.kitchen_pendant # Can include non-light entities
```

**Note:** The `lights` configuration accepts any entity type (light, switch, binary_sensor, etc.) that reports an on/off state.

## Examples

### Basic Multi-Light Setup

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: living_room
features:
  - multi_light_background
```

### Mixed Entity Types

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: bedroom
features:
  - multi_light_background
lights:
  - light.bedroom_ceiling
  - light.bedroom_bedside_left
  - light.bedroom_bedside_right
  - switch.bedroom_accent_lighting
```

### Kitchen with Under-Cabinet Lighting

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: kitchen
features:
  - multi_light_background
lights:
  - light.kitchen_main
  - light.kitchen_under_cabinet
  - light.kitchen_island
```

### Office with Smart Switches

```yaml
type: custom:room-summary-card
area: office
features:
  - multi_light_background
lights:
  - light.office_desk_lamp
  - switch.office_overhead
  - switch.office_accent_lights
  - binary_sensor.office_monitor_backlight
```

## Implementation Details

The multi-light background feature seamlessly integrates with existing functionality:

- **Backwards Compatible**: Existing configurations continue to work unchanged
- **Performance Optimized**: Light entities are tracked efficiently without impacting card performance
- **Theme Aware**: Respects dark mode settings and maintains existing styling behavior
- **Consistent**: Uses the same state checking logic as other card features

This enhancement makes the card more responsive to the actual lighting conditions in multi-light rooms, providing better visual feedback and a more intuitive user experience.

## Troubleshooting

### No Lights Detected Automatically

If automatic discovery isn't finding your lights:

1. Verify the entities are in the correct Home Assistant area
2. Check that entities use the `light.` domain
3. Use manual configuration with the `lights` option

### Background Not Lighting Up

If the background isn't showing when lights are on:

1. Ensure you're using dark mode (feature only works in dark mode)
2. Verify the light entities are actually reporting "on" state
3. Check that `multi_light_background` is in the `features` list

### Performance Issues

If you notice performance problems:

1. Limit the number of tracked entities using manual `lights` configuration
2. Avoid tracking entities that change state very frequently
3. Consider using groups or scenes instead of individual entities
